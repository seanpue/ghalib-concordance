==================

Ghalib Concordance Project

The original data from this project comes from (our) 
Professor Emerita Frances Pritchett’s carefully transcribed work:
http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00ghalib.

This is a work in progress in very early stages. If you are interested in
helping out, please be in touch. There is a substantial amount of proof 
reading and “data munging” that has to happen, so we
need many eyes and ears. 

We also want this to be an entirely open digital humanities project, so all data
and source code will be available at all stages of production. The code/data is
licensed under an MIT license. There has not yet been an official release.

Much like programming scientists, we are both programming humanists and not
professional coders, so suggestions for best practices are always welcome (e.g.
‘use collections’).
